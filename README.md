## About Me
Hi! I'm Aywer. I'm aspiring game developer and programmer from Poland 🇵🇱. I do my work solo or in small team called "Decent Salad Games".
I mostly use Unity and C#, but I also do some stuff in JavaScript & I'm learning c++.
  

## My Proudest Work
- [Giant Enemy Spider](https://ayywer.itch.io/giant-enemy-spider) 

Dynamic First Person Shooter where you have to fight with huge spider while dodging his attacks.

- [Mechaidle](https://ayywer.itch.io/mechaidle) 

Minimalistic 2D tower defence game with robotic theme. Build machines and robots to defend your base. Still in early development.

## My Upcoming Games
Along with my team in **Decent Salad Games** we're preparing for [Steam Next Fest 2026](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest) with our first game **Yavalanche**. **Yavalanche** is a tower defence game, in which you help brave yeti living on top of the mountain repel an atack of the sinister goblins. With the help of the reliable snowball launcher, you can unleash its true power by placing pins that will cause various effects in order to help you defeat your green adversaries.

Demo will be available to play as soon as Next Fest starts. Stay tuned!
